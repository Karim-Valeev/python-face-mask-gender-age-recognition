Together with [Alexander](https://github.com/YODAXYZ/) and [Ruslan](https://github.com/polyarniik), we trained the models and made an application that can recognize whether a person is wearing a medical mask or not. And if not worn, then recognize his gender and age.

It was a very interesting experience and I took a look at technologies such as OpenCV, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras, sklearn

Distribution of duties:
- [Alexander](https://github.com/YODAXYZ/) - Recognition of facial masks, web scraping and the use of trained models
- [Ruslan](https://github.com/polyarniik) - Configuring Age and Gender Recognition models
- [Karim](https://github.com/Karim-Valeev) - Data preprocessing. Search for faces in images. Combining the results of the models into one application
